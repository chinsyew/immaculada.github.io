## History

The Bikol Words "Qui" or "Ki," which means "For," and "Payo," which means "Head," Are the Sources of Quipayo. As a result, it alludes to the fact that Quipayo was in charge of the Christian Mission headquarters at this particular location in the nation.

Currently, Quipayo is a barrios inside the Municipality of Calabanga's civil boundaries, which are dotted around the base of Mount Isarog. The majority of the people that arrived in our region in 1578 were fray. Quipayo is therefore regarded as one of the four parishes in the Archdiocese of Caceres and Bikol overall, according to Pablo De Jesus, O.F.M. Initially, it included all of Libmanan, Calabanga, Bombon, and Siruma.

Over Time, Quipayo Has Become the Mother of Numerous Parishes and a Diocese. It is still an independent parish, though, with Our Lady of the Immaculate Concepcion, also known as "Nuestra Senora De La Inmaculada Concepcion," as its patroness. Her feast day is celebrated on December 8. In 1659, San Roque the Healer, a secondary patron, was adopted; his feast day is observed on August 17 of each year.

## The Structure

Originally, Nipa and bamboo, two native materials, were used to build the Quipayo. Less than 30 years later, in 1616, the Able of Fray built the Ladrillo (Bricks) Church, which is still standing today. Francisco Gaviria, O.F.M. said that all able-bodied men were asked to contribute a ladrillo. The Quipayo Church, one of the oldest Ladrillo churches in the Bikol region, was completed as a major way for the Polo System to reward such efforts.

## Mother of a New Parish

The Parish's original territorial jurisdiction comprised six sitios and fifteen barangays. Still, keeping in mind the spiritual well-being of the faithful and taking the parish's proximity into account, the establishment of the new Sto. Quipayo's territorial jurisdiction was redefined under the tutelage of St. Peregrine Laziosi at Domingo, Calabanga, Camarines Sur. Because the group included in the new parish was distant from the Quipayo parish, it gave the people even greater access to the sacraments. The Church Draws Nearer To The People And The People To The Church. The establishment of the new parish offered personal, up-close shepherding from its own pastor, which is a more effective pastoral approach in reducing the threat and danger that the spread of sects poses to the people's faith.

## Milestone

As of 2020, Quipayo has been a parish for 442 years. The Parish Celebrated San Roque's 361st Anniversary on August 16, 2020. The Feast of San Roque has been moved from its original date of December 9 during Segunda Dia to August 16 on its proper date, along with the associated Novena Masses and prayers. For the first time, the image of San Roque was brought to every barangay and sitio in the parish through a visit that included confession, eucharistic celebration, and catechesis on the life and works of San Roque. Additionally, a new altar, new way of the cross, confessional box was dedicated as a fitting and final remembrance of the occasion of the San Roque festival. August 16, 2012 saw the opening of the New Parish Rectory and the completion of the church pews' repair and varnishing. August 16, 2013 saw the opening of the New Pastoral Center. August 16, 2014 saw the completion of the New Path Way. August 16, 2015 saw the blessing of the New Retablo. And August 16, 2016 saw the completion of the New Altar Ceiling. For these reasons, we are extremely appreciative of the parishioners and sponsors for their efforts, and we give thanks to God for Ina Inmaculada Concepcion's great blessing and guidance.
